High CPU Usage Triage.

Steps :-
1. Identify the process that is consuming the high CPU.
Generally  the result of the command top, should show up the results with the processes, consuming high CPU on Linux environment e.g.
2. Once you have the Process, consuming the high CPU usage, it is just a matter of determining what is happening with the process.
3. The process consuming high CPU,does a I/O, or/and computes.(Considering N/W activity too as a Write to a Socket/Read from a Socket..)
3a. For I/O, check for excessive logging.
3b. This could be with the process throwing continuous exceptions in the log files/debug enabled, etc.
3c. The process could be waiting on, a couple of resources, that are holding to yield the control back. Check for these abnormalities.
4. Computation â€“ This could be into a never ending loop of some kind usually involving IO/Network operations. Possibly bugs sneak in while doing multi threaded programming,which are hard to see, and only manifest during runtime. 
4a. Ideally, if the offending service is restarted, the CPU usage should come back to normal.
5. If you do not get to fix the process consuming high CPU, inspite of getting these checks, its time to add few more cores for processing.
